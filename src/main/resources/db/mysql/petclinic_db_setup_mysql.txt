Spring App sample application - MySQL Configuration

1) Download and install the MySQL database (e.g., MySQL Community Server 5.1.x),
   which can be found here: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/. Or run the 
   "docker-compose.yml" from the root of the project (if you have docker installed
   locally).

2) Create the App database and user by executing the "db/mysql/{schema,data}.sql"
   scripts (or set "spring.datasource.initialize=true" the first time you run the app).
